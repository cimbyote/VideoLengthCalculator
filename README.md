# VideoLengthCalculator
 
 Calculates the total length of a set of input in the form of minutes.seconds. It converts it all to seconds, then adds up total length to calculator the number of hours, minutes and seconds. It then exports to a .txt file that keeps the record.

 Will conver to using SQL eventually.
